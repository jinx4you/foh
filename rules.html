            <h3 class="hello1">Rules of the League !!!</h3>
          <ol class="ol">
              <li>All tournaments will be played on the Advanced Poker Training (APT) website (advancedpokertraining.com). To join is free; simply go to the website, create a username and password, and you’re in!</li>
              <li>Tournament buy-in is $25.00. The entire amount of the buy-in will go to the prize pool. There is no rake or entry fee for playing in the tournament.</li>
              <li>All buy-ins will be paid via PayPal, and will be paid into the money pool titled “NLOP Poker League”. The link for the money pool is noted in the Event listing for the tournament. As the game is password protected, the password will be provided to each player once their buy-in is received.</li>
              <li>The tournament structure is as follows:</li>
              <ol>
                <li>	Game is No-Limit Texas Holdem or Mixed</li>
                <li>  Starting stack: Between 2500 to 7500 chips (Varies by Tourney)</li>
                <li>  Blind levels: 8-12 minutes</li>
                <li>  There will be a 5 minute break after every hour of play</li>
                <li>  Blind start at 10/20; antes will be introduced beginning with the 7th blind level</li>
                <li>Payout structure is percentage based, dependent on the number of registered players. For example, for a 30 player tournament ($750.00 prize pool), the payouts would be:</li>
                <ol>
                  <li>$270 (36%)</li>
                  <li>$172.50 (23%)</li>
                  <li>$112.50 (15%)</li>
                  <li>$82.50 (11%)</li>
                  <li>$60.00 (8%)</li>
                  <li>$52.50 (7%)</li>
                </ol>
              </ol>
              <li>All winnings will be distributed to the winners’ PayPal account within 30 minutes after the completion of the tournament.</li>
              <li>While late registration for the tournament is available (30 minutes), it is strongly encouraged that everyone register prior to the start of the tournament.</li>
              <li>As fans of poker, we all want a friendly, well-played game. Friendly banter between players is, of course, encouraged. Rude, offensive or hateful language will not be tolerated. First offense will get you a warning; subsequent offenses will result in being suspended from the group. This is meant to be fun for everyone; let’s keep it that way!</li>
            </ol>
